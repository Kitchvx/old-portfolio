      I am a tech enthusiast, I am very passionate about technology. I love using different kinds of Linux operating systems such as [Arch Linux](https://archlinux.org/) and [Ubuntu](https://ubuntu.com/), In my spare time away from college and work I like to develop my skills by setting myself goals to achieve such as complex projects and general online courses that offer certificates. I like to stay as active as I can by going to the gym whenever I have free time.

      I would love to get into Cybersecurity, this is the current goal I am working towards and I am currently in an apprenticeship working towards achieving this goal of mine.
